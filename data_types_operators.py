# greetings = 'Hello, World'
#
# # isalpha() helps us find out if the variable is holding letters
#
# print(greetings.isalpha()) # Will return false because there is a space
#
# # islower() checks if statement is lowercase
# print(greetings.islower())
#
# # checks what variable ends and starts with
# print(greetings.endswith("!"))
# print(greetings.startswith("H"))

# # In SQL we have NULL but in Python we have NONE
# x = None
