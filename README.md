## Strings and Casting 
- Indexing in python starts from 0
```python
# # H e l l o   w o r l  d  !
# # 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11
```
## To find out the length of this statement we do len()
```
greetings = "Hello World!"
print(len(greetings))
# For INDEXING we use [] to slice
print(greetings[0:5]) # This will output Hello
print(greetings[6:11]) # This will output World
# Reverse indexing starts with -1
print(greetings[-1])
```
